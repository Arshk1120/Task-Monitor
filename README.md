**TASK MONITOR**
A sleek task management tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 
Task Monitor is designed to help you organize, track, and prioritize your tasks with ease. Whether you’re managing personal projects or a busy workload, this tool keeps everything on track, so you can stay focused and productive.

✨** Key Features:**
Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks effortlessly.
Progress Updates: Mark tasks as in-progress or completed.
Prioritization: Organize tasks by importance to tackle top priorities first.
Simple & Intuitive UI: Built with clean design principles to keep things easy to use.
Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is lightweight, responsive, and easy to expand.

**Explanation**
HTML: The form includes an input for the task, a date picker for the due date, and a dropdown for selecting priority. When the form is submitted, it triggers the JavaScript function to add the task.
CSS: Styles are applied to center the container, style the form elements, and make the buttons visually appealing.
JavaScript: The script handles adding tasks to the list and deleting them when the delete button is clicked. It uses event listeners for form submission and button clicks.

**Running the Project**
Create three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) and copy the respective code into them.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to see the task manager in action.
